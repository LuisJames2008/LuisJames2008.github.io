 <p>For my year 10 work experience week I visited my aunt in London who works at Meta/Facebook as an Apprentoce Software Developer.  On Monday she gave me a tour of the building she works in and explained a bit about the company.</p>
 <p>Meta builds technologies that help people connect, find communities and grow bussinesses. It owns bussinesses including Whatsapp, Facebook and Instagram and has approximately 86,000 employees globally, with approximately 5,000 people based in London.</p>
 <p>As I was not allowed to work on any Meta code my aunt set me a task at the start of the week to work through the start of an online Python course and then to learn about web design and create my own website to share what I have been ding and learning about during this week.  </p>
